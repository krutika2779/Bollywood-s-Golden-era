        <h1 class="entry-title"> What Is the Golden Era Of Indian Cinema?</h1><br>
        <p>The late 1940s-60s was the time which is titled as Golden Age of Indian Cinema Industry.
            And this era is titled as 'Golden Age' by so many film historians and talented film industry people. And of course, the audiences also have a big hand in this.</p><br><br>
        <h1 class="entry-title">What is Golden Era Of Indian Cinema and the reason behind this</h1><br>
        <p>During that time, people became addicted to films. They enjoyed them wholeheartedly. By this, public started experiencing fantasy lives through the films. All these reasons made people crazy about films and the directors also get excited to present new films to the audience.
            This particular period had so many amazing movies. Most of them were blessed with lovely story, wonderful acting skills, and excellent directorial works. Moreover, these movies also had big-budget producing strategy.</p>

        <p>Right after we got our independence, Hindi Cinema took a massive U-turn, and began its journey as a modernistic, free India. Around the early 50's, the filmmakers were inspired by India's freedom struggle, and this ideology reflected in the movies that were made in those initial years of independence. 
            Movies like Naya Daur and Do Bigha Zameen were a major hit, and instantly captured the audiences attention. It wasn't just because of the star cast of the aforementioned films, but also the humble characters and plotlines depicted in them, that made them instant hits. The sheer relatability accounted for its success, both in India and abroad. 
            Movies back then highlighted issues that were relevant. It allowed the audience to connect with it more openly, and also acted as their representative. 
            Mother India, Boot Polish, Naukri and others depicted a plethora of issues ranging from poverty, unemployment, to droughts and famines. Surprisingly so, these issues are still prevalent, yet we see minimal to no representation in today's Bollywood. 
            On that note, these movies further went on to lay the foundation of parallel cinema, which saw its peak only in the late 20th century.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Raj Kapoor is known as the greatest Showman of India, and rightly so. His director self is more popular than his actor self. 
            Shree 420, Anari, Awaara - to name a few - are known not only for its evergreen songs and dynamic pair of Raj & Nargis, but also for their stories. Imagine a movie tackling ongoing issues about fake medicine distribution, property feuds etc in the 50's, when our country was still young. Such confidence is rarely seen these days. 
            Same appreciation goes to Guru Dutt, Bimal Roy, and Mehboob Khan, who brought in critical cinema.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the 60's gave way to 70's, the trends changed. But I'm not here to tell you about the timeline of Hindi Cinema. If you have read till here, I hope you have realised how fulfilling and varied these two decades have been. This is the Golden era that we should aspire to bring back. This is the Hindi cinema that Bollywood should take inspiration from. You will not find stories as original as they were back in this era. The ideas were floating in hundreds, and yet, no two movies were the same. The technology used by the directors then was far inferior than what we have today. But they delivered hits nevertheless, and that is something to learn from. The actors had their individual styles, but were still known for being versatile.</p>
        
        <p> It's a well known adage - the more you read, the better you will write. I believe the same goes for movies. The more we watch, the better movies we will be able to give our audience. The golden era has lots to offer, be it content wise, be it musically, or be it the acting skills. That era was more progressive in its thinking and stories, than even the 90's and onwards. If you can take inspiration from Western classics, why not look home? We can't turn back time, and because the 50's and the 60's are so rich in all aspects, it's nearly impossible to replicate that era. But, we can definitely take inspiration from the stalwarts of Hindi Cinema, and learn from the classics.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: white">The Golden era is called so for a reason, because old is definitely gold.</p>
